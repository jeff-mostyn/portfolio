A selection of code I have written and contributed to

This repository is intended to be an ongoing collection of code I have written as part of projects or practice which 
I feel to be a good representation of myself and my skills. When possible and useful, I will also include gifs or
other examples to show the operation of the code in practice.

Sons of Ra - a game developed and published by myself and classmates from college. Originally a class project, after
  a strongly positive reception we decided to continue development with intent to publish. The game appeared at
  conferences including PAX West, Dreamhack, and E3, and has won multiple awards. The game released after 3 years of
  development in April 2021. Sons of Ra was developed in Unity, and all code samples are in C#.
