The Customization Menu in Sons of Ra is used by the player to select cosmetic settings for in-game play.
This includes color palettes for Player 1 (and Player 2 for local play), a profile picture to represent
them in online play, and cosmetic items for their base.

The script that controls this is set up to be easily understandable and modifiable, with all its 
submenus using a similar function set for core behavior, and a limited number of unique functions to 
carry out functionality specific to that sub menu.
